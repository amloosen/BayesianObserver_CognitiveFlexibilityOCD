# Bayesian Modeling of Confidence in OCD  
**Analyzing Cognitive Task and Confidence Data in OCD Patients**

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and model implementation for a study conducted at Yale School of Medicine. The study examines OCD patients and healthy controls over multiple time points, during which participants:  
- Completed mobile assessments.  
- Played a novel intra- and extra-dimensional shift task with integrated confidence ratings.  

A Bayesian observer model was implemented to capture how confidence ratings should develop under a Bayes-optimal framework, given task information and decision evidence. The resulting parameters from this model are analyzed in relation to psychiatric symptom scores, investigating how clinical symptoms influence decision-making and confidence development.

## Features of the Repository
1. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Processing multi-time point data for OCD patients and controls (to be added).
   - Exploring group-level differences in task performance and confidence ratings.

2. **Bayesian Observer Model**:  
   - Simulates confidence trajectories under optimal conditions.
   - Captures deviations in actual confidence ratings compared to Bayes-optimal predictions.

3. **Psychiatric Symptom Analysis**:  
   - Links Bayesian model parameters to clinical symptom scores.
   - Identifies associations between symptom severity and confidence dynamics.

4. **Group Comparisons**:  
   - Insights into how OCD patients' confidence ratings differ from controls.
   - Analysis of how clinical symptoms (e.g., anxiety, compulsivity and Y-BOCS scores in the patient group) relate to confidence dynamics.
